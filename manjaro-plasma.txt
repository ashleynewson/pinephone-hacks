# Stock Pinephone (Manjaro Plasma) Tips

Undocumented kde superuser with default password (something like 123456 or something like that). Disable that.

Ensure the root password is disabled or under control.

SSH enabled by default. Probably want that disabled if you're not using it or haven't dealt with default passwords.

No iptables rules. Configure?

Uses sddm with autologin. Doesn't seem to work without autologin.

Can use lightdm, but requires some configuration:

- install the lightdm-gtk-greeter (otherwise it won't do anything).
- install onboard and make sure it's configured to use "phone" layout. Still squashed though. Can configure defaults via etc.
