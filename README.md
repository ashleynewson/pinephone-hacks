## Ashley's PinePhone Hacks

A collection of tips and tricks for pinephone.

This is mostly a collection of notes for future reference. If someone else finds these tips useful, then great.

The most significant section is on providing full disk encryption for Manjaro, which isn't officially supported.

## Legal

This is a collection of notes used to document my experience with the
PinePhone. Some of the items contained within may have inherited
slightly restrictive licences. However, I apply no restrictions of my
own.

The repository is made public in good faith that the notes may be of
use to someone else.
